# Reporting format for Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) data and metadata instructions (beta)

A data package containing UAS data should include the following: 

1. Campaign metadata table (csv). 

2. Flight details table (csv), or equivalent output from mission control software.  

3. UAS platform metadata table (csv). 

4. A sensor metadata table (csv) for each sensor used.

5. Data products identified by processing level. Data from one or more processing levels may be included.

## Additional information
UAS platform and sensor technologies are rapidly evolving. Inclusion of additional platform and sensor metadata, such as manufacture specification sheets, is encouraged. 

## Use of this format with other ESS-DIVE reporting formats
The [ESS-DIVE collection of reporting formats](https://github.com/ess-dive-community) includes formats for different measurement types and also for file and metadata structures. The collection is designed to be modular, so use of multiple reporting formats will be required to correctly format a data package. As such, the content of this UAS data and metadata reporting format is limited to guidance specific to UAS data. 

Refer to the [ESS-DIVE Community Space](https://github.com/ess-dive-community) for a complete list of available reporting formats. 

## Example data package
Here is an example data package that follows an early version of these reporting format guidelines. This will be updated when a data package following the completed guidelines becomes available.
